# Dear President Trump,

We need help. America is hurting and so is the rest of the world. We want and need you to succeed, and yet you are currently failing us.

What does success look like? I think the first measure of success is that, based on the work you’ve been putting in, America as a nation is better off.

Unfortunately for us, our nation has been in decline due to the rise of social media and now AI, because corporate focus has been motivated by profit alone rather than mutual value creation and human understanding. If we collaborate rather than fight, we can save a lot of time.

I believe a more sustainable future for success can be defined by profit incentives *and* by the creation of new wealth in the process. Instead of giving people a smaller piece of the same-sized pie, we can aim to build a bigger pie. That way, everyone can have a big enough slice to fit their needs without needless suffering (e.g. the gutting of Medicaid). We need to dream bigger.

Finally, I want you to know that you are loved. To take the word straight out of Stranger In a Strange Land (the inspiration for Elon Musk’s AI tool), that you are grokked, and I hope you grok US too. And by US, I mean all of America, as well as the world, not just your constituents. A lot of that manifests itself as hate because unfortunately it appears as though you're working against the world and therefore yourself.

I have sincere hope that you can find healthy ways to reflect on who has hurt you in the past and offer them forgiveness. That’s the easiest way to stop them from controlling you.

Not all people are as generous as I. they demand answers and rightfully so. Here are a few questions you can answer the public to start making things right again:
- Did you know that the world is dying, and as of today it might already be too late? The diagnosis is grim but hopefully not terminal. Please talk to your friendz at oil companies to understand why they have begun divesting themselves of their main historical profit vehicle.
- Have you paid your judgments and debts? This is easy leverage people can use to manipulate you and form followings against you (and therefore America).
- Can you try honesty and integrity more often? This starts and ends with your self.

Best,
Tidy Wave
